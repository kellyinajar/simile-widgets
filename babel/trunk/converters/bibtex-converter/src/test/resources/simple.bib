     abstract = "Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing is a novel
                 approach to automated document indexing which is
                 based on a statistical latent class model for factor
                 analysis of count data. Fitted from a training corpus
                 of text documents by a generalization of the
                 Expectation Maximization algorithm, the utilized
                 model is able to deal with domain-specific synonymy
                 as well as with polysemous words. In contrast to
                 standard Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) by Singular
                 Value Decomposition, the probabilistic variant has a
                 solid statistical foundation and de nes a proper
                 generative data model. Retrieval experiments on a
                 number of test collections indicate substantial
                 performance gains over direct term matching methods
                 as well as over LSI. In particular, the combination
                 of models with different dimensionalities has proven
                 to be advantageous.",

              are eigenvector methods for identifying "authoritative"
              or "influential" articles, given hyperlink or citation
              information. That such algorithms should give reliable
              or consistent answers is surely a desideratum, and in
              [10], we analyzed when they can be expected to give
              stable rankings under small perturbations to the linkage
              patterns. In this paper, we extend the analysis and show
              how it gives insight into ways of designing stable link
              analysis methods. This in turn motivates two new
              algorithms, whose performance we study empirically using
              citation data and web hyperlink data.}
