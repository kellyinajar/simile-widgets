                 deal with the flow of information in their workspaces.
                 Subjects reported that, in an attempt to quickly and
                 informally manage their information, they created piles
                 of documents. Piles were seen as complementary to the
                 folder filing system. which was used for more formal
                 archiving. A new desktop interface element -- the pile
                 -- was developed and prototyped through an iterative
                 process. The design includes direct manipulation
                 techniques and support for browsing, and goes beyond
                 physical world functionality by providing system
                 assistance for automatic pile construction and
                 reorganization. Preliminary user tests indicate the
                 design is promising and raise issues that will be
                 addressed in future work."

    abstract = "This paper shows that the accuracy of learned text
                classifiers can be improved by augmenting a small
                number of labeled training documents with a large pool
                of unlabeled documents. This is significant because in
                many important text classification problems obtaining
                classification labels is expensive, while large
                quantities of unlabeled documents are readily
                available. We present a theoretical argument showing
                that, under common assumptions, unlabeled data contain
                information about the target function. We then
                introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and
                unlabeled text, based on the combination of
                Expectation-Maximization with a naive Bayes
                classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier
                using the available labeled documents, and
                probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. It
                then trains a new classifier using the labels for all
                the documents, and iterates. Experimental results,
                obtained using text from three different real-world
                tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces
                classification error by up to 30\%.",
