	abstract = {Under-contribution is a problem for many online communities. Social psychology theories of social loafing and goal-setting can provide mid-level design principles to address this problem. We tested the design principles in two field experiments. In one, members of an online movie recommender community were reminded of the uniqueness of their contributions and the benefits that follow from them. In the second, they were given a range of individual or group goals for contribution. As predicted by theory, individuals contributed when they were reminded of their uniqueness and when they were given specific and challenging goals, but other predictions were not borne out. The paper ends with suggestions and challenges for mining social science theories as well as implications for design.},

	abstract = {Ultraconserved elements have been suggested to retain extended perfect sequence identity between the human, mouse, and rat genomes due to essential functional properties. To investigate the necessities of these elements in vivo, we removed four noncoding ultraconserved elements (ranging in length from 222 to 731 base pairs) from the mouse genome. To maximize the likelihood of observing a phenotype, we chose to delete elements that function as enhancers in a mouse transgenic assay and that are near genes that exhibit marked phenotypes both when completely inactivated in the mouse and when their expression is altered due to other genomic modifications. Remarkably, all four resulting lines of mice lacking these ultraconserved elements were viable and fertile, and failed to reveal any critical abnormalities when assayed for a variety of phenotypes including growth, longevity, pathology, and metabolism. In addition, more targeted screens, informed by the abnormalities observed in mice in which genes in proximity to the investigated elements had been altered, also failed to reveal notable abnormalities. These results, while not inclusive of all the possible phenotypic impact of the deleted sequences, indicate that extreme sequence constraint does not necessarily reflect crucial functions required for viability. },

The result is a Web browser that is able to generate personalized semantic hypertext, providing a goal-oriented browsing experience.We present (1) Creo, a Programming by Example system for the Web that allows users to create a general-purpose procedure with a single example, and (2) Miro, a Data Detector that matches the content of a page to high-level user goals.An evaluation with 34 subjects found that they were more efficient using our system, and that the subjects would use features like these if they were integrated into their Web browser.},

	abstract = {Betweenness is a centrality measure based on shortest paths, widely used in complex network analysis. It is computationally-expensive to exactly determine betweenness; currently the fastest-known algorithm by Brandes requires O(nm) time for unweighted graphs and O(nm?+?n 2logn) time for weighted graphs, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges in the network. These are also the worst-case time bounds for computing the betweenness score of a single vertex. In this paper, we present a novel approximation algorithm for computing betweenness centrality of a given vertex, for both weighted and unweighted graphs. Our approximation algorithm is based on an adaptive sampling technique that significantly reduces the number of single-source shortest path computations for vertices with high centrality. We conduct an extensive experimental study on real-world graph instances, and observe that our random sampling algorithm gives very good betweenness approximations for biological networks, road networks and web crawls. },

We address this problem by introducing a novel method for measuring the similarity between short text snippets (even those without any overlapping terms) by leveraging web search results to provide greater context for the short texts. In this paper, we define such a similarity kernel function, mathematically analyze some of its properties, and provide examples of its efficacy. We also show the use of this kernel function in a large-scale system for suggesting related queries to search engine users.},

Composers in a wide range of styles have exploited the non-Euclidean geometry of these spaces, typically by using short line segments between structurally similar chords. Such line segments exist only when chords are nearly symmetrical under translation, reflection, or permutation. Paradigmatically consonant and dissonant chords possess different near-symmetries and suggest different musical uses. },

	abstract = {The need to visualize large and complex networks has strongly increased in the last decade. Although networks with more than 1000 vertices seem to be prohibitive for a comprehensive layout, real-world networks exhibit a very inhomogenous edge density that can be harnessed to derive an aesthetic and structured layout. Here, we will present a heuristic that finds a spanning tree with a very low average spanner property for the non-tree edges, the so-called backbone of a network. This backbone can then be used to apply a modified tree-layout algorithm to draw the whole graph in a way that highlights dense parts of the graph, so-called clusters, and their inter-connections. },

	abstract = {We present an extremely fast graph drawing algorithm for very large graphs, which we term ACE (for Algebraic multigrid Computation of Eigenvectors). ACE exhibits improvement of something like two orders of magnitude over the fastest algorithms we are aware of; it draws graphs of millions of nodes in less than a minute. ACE finds optimal drawing by minimizing a quadratic energy function. The minimization problem is expressed as a generalized eigenvalue problem, which is rapidly solved using novel algebraic multigrid technique. The samegeneralized eigenvalue problem seems to come up also in other fields, hence ACE appears to be applicable outside of graph drawing too.},

Here, we investigate the U.S. House of Representatives network of committees and subcommittees, with committees connected according to "interlocks," or common membership. Analysis of this network reveals clearly the strong links between different committees, as well as the intrinsic hierarchical structure within the House as a whole. We show that network theory, combined with the analysis of roll-call votes using singular value decomposition, successfully uncovers political and organizational correlations between committees in the House without the need to incorporate other political information.},

	abstract = {Office workers everywhere are drowning in email{\~N}not only spam, but also large quan- tities of legitimate email to be read and organized for browsing. Although there have been extensive investigations of automatic document categorization, email gives rise to a num- ber of unique challenges, and there has been relatively little study of classifying email into folders. This paper presents an extensive benchmark study of email foldering using two large corpora of real-world email messages and foldering schemes: one from former Enron em- ployees, another from participants in an SRI research pro ject. We discuss the challenges that arise from differences between email foldering and traditional document classification. We show experimental results from an array of automated classification methods and eval- uation methodologies, including a new evaluation method of foldering results based on the email timeline, and including enhancements to the exponential gradient method Winnow, providing top-tier accuracy with a fraction the training time of alternative methods. We also establish that classification accuracy in many cases is relatively low, confirming the challenges of email data, and pointing toward email foldering as an important area for further research.},
