                   <LI> In joint work with Therese Biedl, Martin Demaine,
                     Sylvain Lazard, Anna Lubiw, Joseph O'Rourke, Steve Robbins,
                     Ileana Streinu, Godfried Toussaint, and Sue Whitesides,
                     it has been shown that general trees linkages cannot
                     always be straightened (disallowing extra folds); see the
                     <a href="../CCCG98c">CCCG'98 paper</a>.
                     This solves the open problem mentioned in Section 5.3,
                     but does not disprove the closed-chain conjecture as
                     claimed in this technical report.  In fact, the
                     closed-chain conjecture is true; see my
                     <A HREF="../../linkage/">linkage

                   <LI> In joint work with Marshall Bern, David Eppstein, and
                     Barry Hayes, the first part of Conjecture 1 has been
                     disproved: it is possible to combine several "local"
                     bisector graphs (instead of using one "global" one) to
                     solve the folding-and-cutting problem.  See the
