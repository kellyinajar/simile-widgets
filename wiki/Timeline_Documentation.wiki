=Timeline Documentation=

This page will be the entry point to the documentation of the [http://code.google.com/p/simile-widgets/ Simile Widgets] *Timeline* component. To reference the previous documentation hosted at MIT please refer to [http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/docs/ html] or [http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Timeline wiki].  We'll try to move all existing (as of September 2nd, 2007) over by September 5th and we'll update the wiki to point to his new site.

Timeline allows web site creators to embed interactive timelines into their sites.  It requires only that visitors have Javascript enabled.

 * The Historical Event Markup and Linking Project http://www.heml.org generates SVG [http://www.heml.org/heml-cocoon/sample-timeline timelines], [http://www.heml.org/heml-cocoon/sample-map maps] and animated maps from documents conforming to its XML markup language for historical events. The markup language, defined in XML Schemas http://heml.mta.ca/Schemas/2003-09-17/heml.xsd, associates events with persons, locations, and keywords, employs multiple calendrical schemes and is multilingual. There is a Heml [http://www.heml.org/heml-cocoon/sample-xhtml xhtml language] available, too. The project's past five years of development are recorded in its SVN server [http://heml.mta.ca/viewsvn/?do=browse&project=heml_svn&path=/]. RDF/Heml ideas were presented at the WWW2006 conference [http://www2006.org/programme/files/xhtml/p199/pp199-robertson-xhtml.html].

 * [http://www.longnow.org/about/longview.php LongView], a project of the [http://www.longnow.org/ The Long Now Foundation], is a server side python script for generating HTML timelines from simple datafiles of comma separated values. It requires Python version 2.3. For generating its graphical elements, LongView also depends on the python [http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/gdmodule.html GD module], which itself depends on Thomas Boutell's GD library (linked to from the python GD module home page). [http://redpuma.net/longview/tree/biotech-html/ Biotechnology Milestones 08000BC - 02022] is an example of LongView in use. Detailed instructions for installation and use are to be found at [http://www.longnow.org/about/LongViewReadMe.php http://www.longnow.org/about/LongViewReadMe.php].
