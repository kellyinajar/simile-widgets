#summary create a custom handler for event click

If you want to use your own handler instead of showing the bubble when clicking on a date, you can use the following Javascript code after loading the .js files:

{{{
  Timeline.OriginalEventPainter.prototype._showBubble = function(x, y, evt) {
   alert (evt.getDescription ());
   }
}}}

In this example just an alert is generated when you click on a bubble. Just make sure every information you need to do that is stored in the description (the text between <event> and </event>).I've used this approach for an event-calendar where people can start editing the event by clicking on the bubble.

If you would like to have a page load when the user clicks on a link, instead of a bubble, use the following code after loading your timeline:

{{{
  Timeline.OriginalEventPainter.prototype._showBubble = function(x, y, evt) {
   document.location.href=evt.getLink();
  }
}}}

Beware that both of these calls can limit functionality. When a user clicks inside of the containing div (which is displaying as a block, so it may extend outside of the title), the action will execute. Since we are using the same area for navigating through the timeline and calling events, there may be a lot of inadvertent functions being called.
