#summary Describes the work flow for committing code to SVN.

= Introduction =

This article describes 2 ways of committing code
  * Using SVN command line
  * Using Eclipse

= Using SVN Command Line =

Download and install:
  * Subversion: [http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html]
  * Ant: [http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi]

Check out the code (example for Exhibit):
  * change to the parent directory of where you want to put the Exhibit code base
  * run at the command line
   svn checkout https://simile-widgets.googlecode.com/svn/exhibit/trunk/ exhibit --username your-google-code-id
  * once that's done, you have a new directory "exhibit"

Working with the code:
  * make changes to the code, test locally, etc.
  * inside the "exhibit" directory, run
   ant
  That should generate the bundle files.

Preparing to commit the code:
  * inside the "exhibit" directory, run
   svn status
  That should list files that have changed and files that are new (i.e., not in SVN). New files are shown with "?" in front.
  * for each new file or new directory, run svn add. For example
   svn add src/webapp/api/locales/es-co
  Note that adding a new directory automatically adds its files.
  * you might want to run svn status again and check that there is no file with "?" in front.

Committing your changes:
  * in the "exhibit" directory, run
   svn commit -m "a comment to describe your changes here" 

= Using Eclipse =

Download and install
  * Subclipse plugin for Eclipse: [http://subclipse.tigris.org/]

Adding a new Subversion repository location:
  * In Eclipse, invoke menu Window -> Show View -> Other, select SVN -> SVN Repository, and click OK. You should then see the SVN Repository view in the Eclipse window.
  * Right-click anywhere inside the SVN Repository view and choose New -> Repository Location...
  * Enter https://simile-widgets.googlecode.com/svn/ for the Url field and click Finish.

Checking out the code (example for Exhibit):
  * In the SVN Repository view, expand the https://simile-widgets.googlecode.com/svn/ location, then find "exhibit", and expand it.
  * Right-click on "trunk" in "exhibit" and choose Checkout... Go through that process; it should be straightforward.
