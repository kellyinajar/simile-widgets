The first step to using Runway is to make sure that the site(s) where the image files are located make available a cross-domain.xml policy file giving permission to Runway to load those image files. Suppose that the image files are coming from http://example.com/, then there must be a http://example.com/crossdomain.xml file

{{{
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM "http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd">
<cross-domain-policy>
  <allow-access-from domain="*" />
</cross-domain-policy>
}}}

Here is [http://www.freebase.com/crossdomain.xml such a file on freebase.com], which grants access to all Flash widgets (including Runway) from all domains. If you want a more restrictive policy, consult Adobe's [http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=tn_14213 technote on cross domain policy].
