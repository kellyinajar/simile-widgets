= Runway =

SIMILE Widget Runway lets you display images in a rich interactive visualization similar to that of Apple iTunes. It is a Flash-based implementation. Here is [http://www.simile-widgets.org/runway/ a live demo].

Just like all the other SIMILE widgets, Runway is open source under the BSD license, and free for you to use. Of course, we would appreciate that you give us due credits by at least linking back to [http://www.simile-widgets.org/runway/].

= Details =

The first step to using Runway is to make sure that the site(s) where the image files are located make available a cross-domain.xml policy file giving permission to Runway to load those image files. Suppose that the image files are coming from http://example.com/, then there must be a http://example.com/crossdomain.xml file

{{{
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM "http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd">
<cross-domain-policy>
  <allow-access-from domain="*" />
</cross-domain-policy>
}}}

Here is [http://www.freebase.com/crossdomain.xml such a file on freebase.com], which grants access to all Flash widgets (including Runway) from all domains. If you want a more restrictive policy, consult Adobe's [http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=tn_14213 technote on cross domain policy].
