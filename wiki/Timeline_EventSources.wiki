Timeline can be populated from different type of data sources.

 # XML format
 # JSON format
 # 

An [Timeline_EventSourceClass Event Source] controls the loading of data sources into a timeline.  

== XML files ==

The XML format used for Timeline goes somewhat like this:

 Everything is contained within a *`<data>`* element
 The *`<data>`* element can have the following attributes:
 # wiki-url - Base url used to gin up url's for each event; by appending the wiki-section and the event's title; often a MediaWiki wiki URL 
 # wiki-section - MediaWiki wiki section
 # events *`<event>`* - Any number of of these elements are supported, the order of these is unimportant.  Each <event> element can have the following attributes:
 # start -- in full date format (e.g. "May 20 1961 00:00:00 GMT-0600"")
 # latestStart - for imprecise beginnings...
 # earliestEnd - for imprecise ends...
 # end - same date format as start
 # isDuration - either "true" or "false", if false the item will be drawn as a dot with a pale bar drawn behind it
 # title - text title that goes next to the bar in the timeline
 # description - more text for the bubble
 # image - url to an image that will be displayed in the bubble
 # link - the bubble's title text will become a hyper-link to this address.
 # icon - this image will appear next to the title text in the bubble.
 # color - color of the bar to display in the timeline
 # textColor - color of the text to display next to the bars
 # The "content" of the element *`<event>_content_</event>`* is what will be displayed inside the bubble that pops up when the event is clicked.  The info should be escaped/formated HTML.

The xml document must be served with a content-type that the browser thinks is xml: "text/xml, application/xml or ends in +xml" (per [http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#xml-response-entity-body the XMLHttpRequest spec]). If it's not, you could get this cryptic error, which I include here as search bait:

TypeError: xml has no properties "XmlHttp: Error handling onReadyStateChange"
[Exception... "'XmlHttp: Error handling onReadyStateChange' when calling method: [nsIOnReadyStateChangeHandler::handleEvent]" nsresult: "0x8057001e (NS_ERROR_XPC_JS_THREW_STRING)" location: "<unknown>" data: no]

_onReadyStateChange(XMLHttpRequest readyState=4 status=200, function(), function())simile-ajax-bundl... (line 2429)
onreadystatechange()

== JSON files  ==

The JSON format used for Timeline goes somewhat like this:

 Everything is contained in *`{}`*
 The base element can have the following attributes:
 # wiki-url - Base url used to gin up url's for each event; by appending the wiki-section and the event's title; often a MediaWiki wiki URL 
 # wiki-section - MediaWiki wiki section
 # dateTimeFormat - format of the date time (i.e.'iso8601')
 # events - Inside 'events' goes an array of elements, the order of these is unimportant.  Each event element can have the following attributes:
 # start - in full date format (e.g. "May 20 1961 00:00:00 GMT-0600"")
 # [Timeline_EventSourceJSON JSON Event Source - _use_js_Date%28%29_objects]] can make dates easier
 # latestStart - for imprecise beginnings...
 # earliestEnd - for imprecise ends...
 # end - same date format as start
 # isDuration - either "true" or "false", if false the item will be drawn as a dot with a pale bar drawn behind it
 # title - text title that goes next to the bar in the timeline
 # description - more text for the bubble
 # image - url to an image that will be displayed in the bubble
 # link - the bubble's title text will become a hyper-link to this address.
 # icon - this image will appear next to the title text in the bubble.
 # color - color of the bar to display in the timeline
 # textColor - color of the text to display next to the bars
 # description - what will be displayed inside the bubble that pops up when the event is clicked.  It should be escaped/formated HTML.
