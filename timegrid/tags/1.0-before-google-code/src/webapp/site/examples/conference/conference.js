			"description" : "The Royal Institute Elcano\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u0080  (Real Instituto Elcano) in Spain is a prestigious independent political institute whose mission is to comment on the political situation in the world focusing on its relation to Spain. As part of its dissemination strategy it operates a public website. In this paper we present and evaluate the application of a semantic search engine to improve access to the Institute\'s content: instead of retrieving documents based on user queries of keywords, the system accepts queries in natural language and returns answers rather than links to documents. Topics that will be discussed include ontology construction, automatic ontology population, semantic access through a natural language interface and a failure analysis.",

			"description" : "Resolving semantic heterogeneity among information sources is a central problem in information interoperation, information integration, and information sharing among websites. Ontologies express the semantics of the terminology used in these websites. Semantic heterogeneity can be resolved by mapping ontologies from diverse sources. Mapping large ontologies manually is almost impossible and results in a number of errors of omission and commission. Therefore, automated ontology mapping algorithms are a must. However, most existing ontology mapping tools do not provide exact mappings. Rather, there is usually some degree of uncertainty.We describe a framework to improve existing ontology mappings using a Bayesian Network. Omen, an Ontology Mapping ENhancer uses a set of meta-rules that capture the influence of the ontology structure and the semantics of ontology relations and matches nodes that are neighbors of already matched nodes in the two ontologies. We have implemented a protype ontology matcher using probabilistic methods that can enhance existing matches between ontology concepts. Experiments demonstrate that Omen successfully identifies and enhances ontology mappings significantly.",

			"description" : "The paper reports on the formal framework to design strategies for multiissue non-symmetric meaning negotiations among software agents in a distributed information retrieval system. The advancements of the framework are the following. A resulting strategy compares the contexts of two background domain theories not concept by concept, but the whole context (conceptual graph) to the other context by accounting the relationships among concepts, the properties and the constraints over properties. It contains the mechanisms for measuring contextual similarity through assessing propositional substitutions and to provide argumentation through generating extra contexts. It uses presuppositions for choosing the best similarity hypotheses and to make the mutual concession to common sense monotonic. It provides the means to evaluate the possible eagerness to concede through semantic commitments and related notions of knowledgeability and degree of reputation",

OWL-DL is much more expressive than WS-Policy and thus provides a framework for exploring richer policy languages.",

			"description" : "To date on-line processes (i.e. workflows) built in e-Science have been the result of collaborative team efforts. As more of these workflows are built, scientists start sharing and reusing stand-alone compositions of services, or workflow fragments. They repurpose an existing workflow or workflow fragment by finding one that is close enough to be the basis of a new workflow for a different purpose, and making small changes to it. Such a \'workflow by example\'\' approach complements the popular view in the Semantic Web Services literature that on-line processes are constructed automatically from scratch, and could help bootstrap the Web of Science. Based on a comparison of e-Science middleware projects, this paper identifies seven bottlenecks to scalable reuse and repurposing. We present initial work towards the two areas where semantic reasoning can be expected to offer most help: a comprehensive fragment discovery model and rankings for workflow fragments.",

			"description" : "Ontology alignment is a prerequisite in order to allow for interoperation between different ontologies and many alignment strategies have been proposed to facilitate the alignment task by (semi)automatic means. Due to the complexity of the alignment task, manually defined methods for (semi)automatic alignment rarely constitute an optimal configuration of substrategies from which they have been built. In fact, scrutinizing current ontology alignment methods, one may recognize that most are not optimized for given ontologies. Some few include machine learning for automating the task, but their optimization by machine learning means is mostly restricted to the extensional definition of ontology concepts. With APFEL (Alignment Process Feature Estimation and Learning) we present a machine learning approach that explores the user validation of initial alignments for optimizing alignment methods. The methods are based on extensional and intensional ontology definitions. Core to APFEL is the idea of a generic alignment process, the steps of which may be represented explicitly. APFEL then generates new hypotheses for what might be useful features and similarity assessments and weights them by machine learning approaches. APFEL compares favorably in our experiments to competing approaches.",

				"Coordination is the process of managing the possible interactions between activities and processes",
				"a mechanism to handle such interactions is known as a coordination regime. A successful coordination regime will prevent negative interactions occurring e.g., by preventing two processes from simultaneously accessing a non-shareable resource), and wherever possible will facilitate positive interactions (e.g., by ensuring that activities are not needlessly duplicated). We start from the premise that effective coordination mechanisms require the sharing of knowledge about activities, resources and their properties, and hence, that in a heterogeneous environment, an ontological approach to coordination is appropriate. After surveying recent work on dynamic coordination, we describe an ontology for coordination that we have developed with the goal of coordinating semantic web processes.We then present a implementation of our ideas, which serves as a proof of concept for how this ontology can be used for dynamic coordination. We conclude with a summary of the presented work, illustrate its relation to the Semantic Web, and provide insights into future extensions."

These concepts and algorithms are broadly applicable since they are independent of a particular variant of an underlying logic (with monotonic semantics) and independent of a particular reasoning system.

			"description" : "We present a method for rapid development of benchmarks for Semantic Web knowledge base systems. At the core, we have a synthetic data generation approach for OWL that is scalable and models the real world data. The data-generation algorithm learns from real domain documents and generates benchmark data based on the extracted properties relevant for benchmarking. We believe that this is important because relative performance of systems will vary depending on the structure of the ontology and data used. However, due to the novelty of the Semantic Web, we rarely have sufficient data for benchmarking. Our approach helps overcome the problem of having insufficient real world data for benchmarking and allows us to develop benchmarks for a variety of domains and applications in a very time efficient manner. Based on our method, we have created a new Lehigh BibTeX Benchmark and conducted an experiment on four Semantic Web knowledge base systems. We have verified our hypothesis about the need for representative data by comparing the experimental result to that of our previous Lehigh University Benchmark. The difference in both experiments has demonstrated the influence of ontology and data on the capability and performance of the systems and thus the need of using a representative benchmark for the intended application of the systems.",

The agents composing SERSE use ontological descriptions to search and retrieve semantically annotated knowledge sources, by maintaining a semantic index of the instances of the annotation ontology. The efficient retrieval is made it possible through the semantic routing mechanism, that permits to identify the agent indexing the resources requested by a user query without having to maintain a central index, and by reducing the number of messages broadcasted to the system. The system is also capable of exhibiting autonomic behaviour. Autonomic behaviour is characterised by self configuration and self healing capabilities, aimed at permitting the system to manage the failure of one of its agents and ensure continuous functioning.",

Some content oriented patterns are presented in order to illustrate their utility at different degrees of abstraction, and how they can be specialized or composed. The proposed frame and the initial set of patterns are designed in order to function as a pipeline connecting domain modelling, user requirements, and ontology-driven tasks/queries to be executed.",

				"This paper extends the model theory of RDF with rules, putting emphasis on integration with OWL and decidability of entailment. We start from an abstract syntax that views a rule as a pair of rule graphs, which generalize RDF graphs by also allowing rule variables in subject, predicate, and object positions. In the model theory we make no restrictive assumptions, thereby extending the metamodeling capabilities of RDFS",
				"in particular, classes and properties can be viewed as instances. We integrate RDFS as well as a decidable, intensional variant of OWL which weakens OWL Full and for which a complete set of simple entailment rules is available. Almost all examples in the DAML set of test rules are covered by our approach."

			"description" : "Ontologies are today a key part of every knowledge based system. But the variety of ways that a domain can be conceptualized results in the creation of different ontologies with contradicting or overlapping parts. For this reason ontologies need to be brought into mutual agreement (aligned). One important method for ontology alignment is the comparison of class and property names of ontologies using string-distance metrics. Today quite a lot of such metrics exist in literature. But all of them have been initially developed for different applications and fields resulting in poor performance when applied in this new domain. In the current paper we present a new string metric for the comparison of names which performs better on the process of ontology alignment as well as to many other field matching problems.",

			"description" : "E-science experiments typically involve many distributed services maintained by different organisations. After an experiment has been executed, it is useful for a scientist to verify that the execution was performed correctly or is compatible with some existing experimental criteria or standards. Scientists may also want to review and verify experiments performed by their colleagues. There is no existing framework for validating such experiments. Users therefore have to rely on error checking performed by the services, or adopt other ad hoc methods. This paper introduces a platform independent framework for validating workflow executions. The validation relies on reasoning over the documented emph{provenance} of experiment results and emph{semantic descriptions} of services advertised in a registry. This validation process ensures experiments are performed correctly, and thus results generated are meaningful. The framework is tested in a bioinformatics application that performs protein compressibility analysis.",

In addition, RUL supports fine-grained updates at the class and property instance level, set-oriented updates with a deterministic semantics and takes benefit of the full expressive power of RQL for restricting the range of variables to nodes and arcs of RDF graphs.

For the representation of encrypted data and encryption metadata, the XML-Encryption and XML-Signature standards are used. For fragment selection and the specification of encryption policies, the RDQL query language is adapted.

			"description" : "Abstract. Besides the reduction of time to market, there may be observed another trend in the automotive industry: built to order. Built to order reduces the mass production of cars to a limited lot production. Emphasis for optimization issues moves then from the production step to earlier steps as the collaboration of suppliers and manufacturer in development and delivering. Thus knowledge has to be shared between different organizations and departments in early development processes. In this paper we describe a project in the automotive industry where ontologies have two main purposes: (i) representing and sharing knowledge to optimize business processes for the testing of cars and (ii) inte-gration of life data into this optimization process. A test car configuration assis-tant (semantic guide) is built on top of an inference engine equipped with an ontology containing information about parts and configuration rules. The ontology is attached to the legacy systems of the manufacturer and thus accesses and integrates up to date information.

			"description" : "OntoClean is a unique approach towards the formal evaluation of ontologies, as it analyses the intensional content of concepts. Although it is well documented and explained in numerous publications, and its importance is widely acknowledged, it is nevertheless used rather infrequently due to the high costs for applying OntoClean, especially on tagging concepts with the correct metaproperties. In order to facilitate the use of OntoClean and to enable proper evaluation of it in real-world cases, we provide AEON, a tool which automatically tags concepts with appropriate OntoClean meta-properties. The implementation can be easily expanded to check the concepts for other abstract meta-properties, thus providing for the first time tool support in order to enable intensional ontology evaluation for concepts. Our main idea is using the web as an embodiment of objective world knowledge, we search for patterns indicating concepts meta-properties.We get an automatic tagging of the ontology, thus reducing costs tremendously. Moreover, AEON lowers the risk of having subjective taggings. As part of the evaluation we report our experiences from creating a middle-sized OntoClean-tagged reference ontology.",

The enrichment process is accomplished by searching the same news expressed by different agencies reachable over the Web. Metadata extraction from the alternative sources (i.e. Web pages) is similarly applied and finally integration of the sources (according to some heuristic of pertinence) is carried out. Performance evaluation of the current system prototype has been carried out on a large scale. It confirms the viability of the RitroveRAI approach for realistic (i.e. 24 hours) applications and continuous monitoring and metadata extraction from multimedia news data.",

This problem has been extensively studied in the field of belief change, the dominating approach being the AGM theory. This theory set the standard for determining the rationality of a given belief change mechanism but was placed in a certain context which makes it inapplicable to logics used in the Semantic Web, such as Description Logics (DLs) and OWL. We believe the Semantic Web community would benefit from the application of the AGM theory to such logics. This paper is a preliminary study towards the feasibility of this application. Our approach raises interesting theoretical challenges and has an important practical impact too, given the central role that DLs and OWL play in the Semantic Web.",

			"description" : "A common practice in conceptual modeling is to divide the model into an intensional and an extensional part. Although very intuitive, this approach falls short in many complex domains, where the borderline between the two is not clearcut. Therefore, OWL-Full, the most expressive of the Semantic Web ontology languages, allows mixing the intensional and the extensional model by a feature we refer to as metamodeling. Until now, the computational properties of metamodeling in OWL-Full have been unknown. Here, we show that the semantics of metamodeling adopted in OWL-Full leads to undecidability of basic inference problems. We analyze this result and show that it is due to free mixing of logical and metalogical symbols. Moreover, we propose two alternatives: the contextual and the HiLog semantics, and show that SHIQ -- a description logic underlying OWL -- under either semantics is decidable. Finally, we discuss the expressivity of these semantics.",

In addition, the distributions of the ontology instances and instance relations are also depicted in the ``imaging\'\'. We introduce at length the key techniques and algorithms used in our approach.

			"description" : "Structured Clinical Documentation is a fundamental component of the healthcare enterprise linking both clinical (e.g., electronic health record, clinical decision support) and administrative functions (e.g., e&m coding, billing). Documentation templates have proven to be an effective mechanism for implementing structured clinical documentation. The ability to create and manage definitions, i.e., definitions management for various concepts such as diseases, drugs, contraindications, complications, etc. is crucial for creating and maintaining documentation templates in a consistent manner across the organization. Definitions management involves creation and management of concepts that may be apart of controlled vocabularies, information models and ontologies. In this paper, we present a real world implementation of a semantics-based approach to structured clinical documentation based on description logics (DL) system for ontology management. In this context, we present ontological underpinnings viz., the information, document and presentation ontologies on which clinical documents are based. We will present techniques that leverage these ontologies to render static and dynamic templates that contain branching logic. We evaluate the role of these ontologies in the context of managing the impact of definition changes on the creation and rendering of these documentation templates, and the ability to retrieve documentation templates and their instances precisely in a given clinical context.",

In this paper we benchmark three popular database representations of RDF/S schemata and data: (a) a schema-aware (i.e., one table per RDF/S class or property) with explicit (ISA) or implicit (NOISA) storage of subsumption relationships, (b) a schema-oblivious (i.e., a unique table with triples of the form ), using (ID) or not (URI) identifiers to represent a resource URI on the subject of each triple and (c) a hybrid of the schema-aware and schema-oblivious representations (i.e., one table per RDF/S meta-class by distinguishing also the range type of properties). Furthermore, we benchmark two common approaches for evaluating taxonomic queries either on-the-fly (ISA, NOISA, Hybrid), or by precomputing the transitive closure of subsumption relationships (Mat View, URI, ID). The main conclusion drawn from our experiments is that the evaluation of taxonomic queries is most efficient over RDF/S stores utilizing the Hybrid and Mat View representations. Of the rest, schema-aware representations (ISA, NOISA) exhibit overall better performance than URI, which is superior to that of ID, which exhibits the overall worst performance.",

			"description" : "Ontologies and automated reasoning are the building blocks of the Semantic Web initiative. Derivation rules can be included in an ontology to define derived concepts based on base concepts. For example, rules allow to define the extension of a class or property based on a complex relation between the extensions of the same or other classes and properties. On the other hand, the inclusion of negative information both in the form of negation as failure and explicit negative information is also needed to enable various forms of reasoning. In this paper, we extend RDF graphs with weak and strong negation, as well as derivation rules. The ERDF stable model semantics of the extended framework (Extended RDF) is defined, extending RDF(S) semantics. A distinctive feature of our theory, which is based on partial logic, is that both truth and falsity extensions of properties and classes are considered, allowing for truth value gaps. Our framework supports both closed-world and open-world reasoning through the explicit representation of the particular closed-world assumptions and the ERDF ontological categories of total properties and total classes.",

However, all these algorithms focus on single item recommendations and do not consider any more complex recommendation structures. This paper explores how semantically rich complex recommendation structures, represented as RDF graphs, can be exchanged and shared in a distributed social network. After presenting a motivating scenario we define several annotation ontologies we use in order to describe context information on the user desktop and show how our ranking algorithm can exploit this information.We discuss how social distributed networks and interest groups are specified using extended FOAF vocabulary, and how members of these interest groups share semantically rich recommendations in such a network. These recommendations transport shared context as well as ranking information, described in annotation ontologies. We propose an algorithm to compute these rankings which exploits available context information and show how rankings are influenced by the context received from other users as well as by the reputation of the members of the social network with whom the context is exchanged.",

Initially, we encode the knowledge of an agent as a logic program equipped with call literals. Such call literals enable the agent to pose yes/no queries to arbitrary knowledge sources on the Semantic Web, without conditions on, e.g., the representation language of those sources. As conflicts may arise from reasoning with different knowledge sources, we use the extended answer set semantics, which can provide different strategies for solving those conflicts. Allowing, in addition, for an agent to express its preference for the satisfaction of certain rules over others, we can then induce a preference order on those strategies. However, since it is natural for an agent to believe its own knowledge (encoded in the program) but consider some sources more reliable than others, it can alternatively express preferences on call literals. Finally, we show how an agent can learn preferences on call literals if it is part of a web of trusted agents.",

We show that the temporal logic approach can provide a solid semantic foundation which can support various requirements on multiversion ontology reasoning.

			"description" : "Swoogle is a system that helps knowledge engineers and software agents find knowledge on the web encoded in the semantic web languages RDF and OWL. Based on the search mechanisms provided in the previous version, we add two new features, namely the semantic web navigation model and some mechanisms for ranking the semantic web at various granularities. Although the semantic web is materialized on the Web, it is hard to navigate within the semantic web since few explicit \'hyperlinks\' are available besides an URIref\'s namespace or owl:import semantic. Hence we propose a navigation model that characterizes users\' navigational behavior (e.g. surfing from an ontology to one class C defined in it, and then to the RDF documents that populates C or the other resources that helps defining this class) within the semantic web and implement it in Swoogle\'s \'Ontology Dictionary\'. Based on this navigation model and the metadata collected in Swoogle, we developed some algorithms for ranking objects in the semantic web at various granularities including semantic web document (SWD), term (e.g., RDF class or property) and fact (i.e., RDF triple). Ranking SWDs, inspired by the Google\'s PageRank, emulates an \'rational\' agent acquiring knowledge on the semantic web using the hyperlinks provided by our \'semantic web navigation model\' at document level. Ranking individual terms extends ranking to a finer granularity. For example, from the hundreds of RDF terms denoting the concept of a person, the question of \'which are most widely used?\' is answered by term ranking. Finally, we introduce the notion of ranking facts (e.g., RDF triples) such as the rdfs:domain relation between a class and a property using provenance based heuristics. These ranking mechanisms, if being used, could help the emergence of consensus ontologies. Experiments show that the Swoogle search engine using \'semantic ranking\' outperforms Google in evaluating the importance of ontologies.",

			"description" : "Discovery of semantic associations in Semantic Web ontologies is an important task in various analytical activities. Several query languages and storage systems have been designed and implemented for storage and retrieval of information in RDF ontologies. However, they are inadequate for semantic association discovery. In this paper we present the design and implementation of BRAHMS, an efficient RDF storage system, specifically designed to support fast semantic association discovery in large RDF bases. We present memory usage and timing results of several tests performed with BRAHMS and compare them to similar tests performed using Jena, Sesame, and Redland, three of the well-known RDF storage systems. Our results show that BRAHMS handles basic association discovery well, while the RDF query languages and even the low-level APIs in the other three tested systems are not suitable for the implementation of semantic association discovery algorithms.",

In Australia, the introduction of a water rights management framework is an administrative attempt to facilitate the resolution of this complex and multi-faceted problem. Policies relating to water allocation and trading have already ad-vanced beyond our abilities to monitor, measure, report and enforce these policies. Mis-management of this valued resource can have severe damaging long term environmental and economic effects. We believe that Semantic Web Services technologies will help deci-sion makers minimise the risk of mismanagement. In this paper, we discuss the potential application of our Dynamic Service Composition method and its compatibility with the present approaches.

			"description" : "Domain ontologies very rarely model verbs as relations holding between concepts. However, the role of the verb as a central connecting element between concepts is undeniable. Verbs specify the interaction between the participants of some action or event by expressing relations between them. In parallel, it can be argued from an ontological point of view that verbs express a relation between two concepts that specify domain and range. The work described here is concerned with relation extraction for ontology extension along these lines. We describe a system (RelExt) that is capable of automatically identifying highly relevant triples (pairs of concepts connected by a relation) over concepts from an existing ontology. RelExt works by extracting relevant verbs and their grammatical arguments (i.e. terms) from a domain-specific text collection and computing corresponding relations through a combination of linguistic and statistical processing. The paper includes a detailed description of the system architecture and evaluation results on a constructed benchmark. RelExt has been developed in the context of the SmartWeb project, which aims at providing intelligent information services via mobile broadband devices on the FIFA World Cup that will be hosted in Germany in 2006. Such services include location based navigational information as well as question answering in the soccer domain.",

In this paper we present innovative algorithms called INGA (Interest-based Node Grouping Algorithms) which integrate personal routing indices into semantic query processing to boost performance. Similar to social networks peers in INGA cooperate to efficiently route queries for documents along adaptive shortcut-based overlays using only local, but semantically well chosen information. We propose active and passive shortcut creation strategies for index building and a novel algorithm to select the most promising content providers depending on each peer index with respect to the individual query. We quantify the benefit of our indexing strategy by extensive performance experiments in the SWAP simulation infrastructure. While obtaining high recall values compared to other state of the art algorithms, we show that INGA improves recall and reduces the number of messages significant.",

				"This paper describes the design of and the deployment options for the Federal Enterprise Architecture Reference Model Ontology (FEA RMO). The goal of any reference model is to provide a basis or starting point for some design process. While this is a laudable goal, it poses an immediate problem for representation",
				"how can a model be represented in such a way that it can be extended in certain ways (for application to a particular problem), but not without regard to the advice that it gives? Reference models are usually expressed in natural language. At their best, reference models provide a starting point for designers, and a checklist for their designs, to see that they conform to industry best practices. At worst, reference models become a source of busy work",
				"designers proceed however they please, and spend some afterthought writing up an excuse for why they are compliant with the reference model that they never laid eyes on before. In this paper, we have used Semantic Web technologies (in particular, RDF and OWL) to represent a reference mode for enterprise architecture in the US government. The content of the model comes from the recent Federal Enterprise Architecture Reference Model effort. We use the capability of RDF to distribute structured information to allow the reference model to be extended (as intended in its design). We use OWL to maintain the consistency of those extensions. The model has been used as the basis for an implementation of an FEA registry, a webbased system for managing enterprise architectures based on the FEA. The work of representing the FEA as formal ontologies was funded in part by GSA. Keywords: Government Sector, Portals, Knowledge Management"

In this paper we present sound and complete algorithms for the containment and minimization of RDF/S query patterns. More precisely, we consider two RDF/S query fragments supporting pattern matching at the data, but also, at the schema levels. To this end we advocate a logic framework for capturing the RDF/S data model and semantics and we employ well-established techniques proposed in the relational context, in particular, the chase and backchase algorithms.",

The Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) is an important first step in defining such a rule language. This paper describes the development of a configurable interoperation environment for SWRL built in the ProtTgT OWL Plugin, the most widely-used OWL development platform. This environment supports both a highly-interactive, fullfeatured editor for SWRL and a plugin mechanism for integrating third party rule engines. We have integrated the popular Jess rule engine into this environment, thus providing one of the first steps on the path to rule integration on the Web.",

Document markup is still often incomplete, inconsistent, incorrect, and limited to keywords via HTML and XML tags. OWL promises to bring semantics to this markup to improve its machine understandability. A usable markup tool is becoming a barrier to the more widespread use of OWL markup in operational settings. This paper describes some of our attempts at building markup tools, lessons learned, and our latest markup tool, the Semantic Markup Tool (SMT). SMT uses automatic text extractors and templates to hide ontological complexity from end users and helps them quickly specify events and relationships of interest in the document. SMT automatically generates correct and consistent OWL markup. This comes at a cost to expressivity. We are evaluating SMT on several pilot semantic web efforts.",

This paper describes a Situation Awareness Assistant (SAWA) based on Semantic Web technologies that facilitates the development of user-defined domain knowledge in the form of formal ontologies and rule sets and then permits the application of the domain knowledge to the monitoring of relevant relations as they occur in evolving situations. SAWA includes tools for developing ontologies in OWL and rules in SWRL and provides runtime components for collecting event data, storing and querying the data, monitoring relevant relations and viewing the results through a graphical user interface. An application of SAWA to a scenario from the domain of supply logistics is presented along with a discussion of the challenges encountered in using SWRL for this task.",

Probabilities needed for constructing conditional probability tables (CPT) during translation and for measuring semantic similarity during mapping are learned using text classification techniques where each concept in an ontology is associated with a set of semantically relevant text documents, which are obtained by ontology guided web mining. The basic ideas of this approach are validated by positive results from computer experiments on real-world ontologies."

			"description" : "The semantic web presents the vision of a distributed, dynamically growing knowledge base founded on formal logic. Common users, however, seem to have problems even with the simplest Boolean expression. As queries from web search engines show, the great majority of users simply do not use Boolean expressions. So how can we help users to query a web of logic that they do not seem to understand? We address this problem by presenting a natural language interface to semantic web querying. The interface allows formulating queries in Attempto Controlled English (ACE), a subset of natural English. Each ACE query is translated into a discourse representation structure - a variant of the language of first-order logic - that is then translated into an N3-based semantic web querying language using an ontology-based rewriting framework. As the validation shows, our approach offers great potential for bridging the gap between the semantic web and its real-world users, since it allows users to query the semantic web without having to learn an unfamiliar formal language. Furthermore, we found that users liked our approach and designed good queries resulting in a very good retrieval performance (90% precision and 90% recall).",

			"description" : "Much data is published on the Web in XML format satisfying schemas, and to make the Semantic Web a reality, such data needs to be interpreted with respect to ontologies. Interpretation is achieved through a semantic mapping between the XML schema and the ontology. We present work on the heuristic construction of complex such semantic mappings, between XML schemas and ontologies when given an initial set of simple correspondences from XML schema attributes to datatype properties in the ontology. To accomplish this, we first offer a mapping formalism to capture the semantics of XML schemas. Second, we present our heuristic mapping construction algorithm. Finally, we show through an empirical study that considerable effort can be saved when constructing complex mappings by using our prototype tool.",

			"description" : "In this paper, we investigate the (in)dependence among OWL documents with respect to the logical consequence when they are combined, in particular the inference of concept and role assertions about individuals. One the one hand, we present a systematic approach to identifying those documents that affect the inference of a given fact. On the other hand, we consider ways for fast detection of independence. First, we demonstrate several special cases in which two documents are independent of each other. Secondly, we introduce an algorithm for checking the independence in the general case. In addition, we describe two applications in which the above results have allowed us to develop novel approaches to overcome some difficulties with reasoning on large scale OWL data. Both applications demonstrate the usefulness of this work for improving the scalability of a practical Semantic Web system that relies on the reasoning about individuals.",
